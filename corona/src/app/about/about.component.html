            <p class="mb-4">COVID Champions is an effort to bring notice to the world about the health care professionals
              that were died while treating COVID patients. All over the world, many of these professionals
              are serving their nations by treating COVID patients. Unfortunately, few were dead while
              helping and treating COVID patients. These professionals lost their lives for us and they deserve
              all our solidarity.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Covid Champions definitely made a mark all over us through their determination to excel
              well in their responsibilities and by sacrificing their lives for a good cause. This is the main
              reason to come up with this website to remember well these covid champions always and
              forever here. Your solidarity shown here will stay permanent the way they stay with us all
              virtually here. Covid Champions Live with Us forever at here and your solidarity can be a great
              complement to them to all. </p>
            <p class="mb-4">These healthcare professionals are constantly giving us the message that our lives are precious
              and fight together against the pandemic Covid-19. Limits less service from these professionals is
              just not about job responsibility and it is their effort to save the public. This is a pure patriotism
              to their nation that we all should learn and follow them. </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              The website will be updated constantly by adding the latest happenings and its developed and
              maintained through the generous contributions from Anshi Parnika Perla and Vedamsa Keerthy.
